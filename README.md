# Live object detection using MobileNetSSD with OpenCV
This script uses OpenCV's DNN library to load weights from a MobileNet SSD tensorflow model.
The classes available are from the COCO dataset.

Thanks to Adrian from pyimagesearch for introducing me to imutils which I find much more stable for video capture.
